# Hadoop Cluster with YARN and Spark configured

### The cluster location

This hadoop cluster is running on 4 VMs in the school hypervisor vSphere. You can find it under this path :

```bash
ESIPE-Creteil/Etudiants/ING3/Data/Hadoop Cluster
```


### Hardware configuration

In order to create the cluster, you have to setup 4 VMs with the following hardware and software:
<ul>
<li> CPU : 4
<li> RAM : 4 GB
<li> HDD : 32 GB
<li> Linux Ubuntu 18.04.4-live-server </li>
<li> Java 1.8 </li>
</ul>

### Network

In order to create the cluster, you have to set up the network of the cluster like in this screen :

![alt text](https://github.com/YohanEngineer/learningSpark/blob/main/Hadoop%20network.png)

For this cluster, we used and configured the network with NETPLAN. We configured the YAML
file of netplan that can be found here in each VM :

```bash 
/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Open it with :

```bash 
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Then fill each VM with it's configuration.

  version: 2
```
To make ubuntu acknowledge the new configuration make this two commands :

```bash 
sudo netplan apply
sudo reboot 
```

YOU ARE THE KING/QUEEN :crown: , you sucessfully set up the network of your cluster. Now, let's get some fun.
